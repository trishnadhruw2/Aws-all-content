VPC [Virtual Private Cloud]:

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

Amazon VPC is the AWS Virtual Private Cloud. A VPC logically separates your virtual network from all other AWS customers and from the internet. Think of it as a container for all the networking that you do when running on AWS.

- A Virtual Private Cloud is like a private network which create on a cloud.
- It is a logically isolated network from other network which created in a cloud.
- Amazon VPC enables you to build a virtual network in the AWS cloud - no VPNs, hardware, or physical datacenters required. You can define your own network space, and control how your network work.
- We can create maximum 5 VPC (one region) and each VPC can have 200 setup subnet.
- When we create VPC then DHCP,Security Group and NACL created automatically.
=============================================================
Type of VPC:
1. Default VPC
2. Custom VPC

1. Default VPC
- It present bydefault in every region of AWS
- It by default have CIDR,Security Group, NACL and other routing table configuration.
- It also have defult gateway

2. Custom VPC:
- we can create custome VPC as per out requirement(with custom CIDR)
- Security Goup, NACL and other routing table created bydefault at time of VPC creation.
- it does not have internet gateway,we need to create manualy if required

===================================================================================
Type of subnet

Public Subnet-
Basically public subnet connected with internet,
It is connected with internet gateway. means system attached in public subnet directly can communicate with internet.

Private Subnet:
private susbnet not connected with internet gateway.
It is not connected with internet gateway, means system attached in private subnet does not directly communicate with internet.
===================================================================================
VPC & Subnet Creation rule:

When we create VPC, we need to assign ip address and CIDR(prefix/network bit) to VPC.
AWS VPC allow us to create CIDR from 16 to 28 Range.

eg. 
If we create VPC = 10.0.0.0/25  ( Then we got total 2^7=128 IP address)

Inside VPC we need to create Subnets, when we create subnet 5 ip address reserved,  means 5 ip address reduce from subnet block size for following purpose -

- First 4 ip and last 1 is reserved (Total 5 IP Reserved)  ( subnet = 10.0.0.0/26)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. First IP Reserved for Network ID 		= 10.0.0.0 

2. AWS Reserved 2nd IP for Router (Gateway) 	=10.0.0.1 

3. AWS Reserved 3rd IP for DNS Server 		=10.0.0.2

4. AWS Reserve 4th IP for future usage 		 =10.0.0.3

5. Last IP address reserved for Broadcast		 =10.0.0.63
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eg.

VPC = 10.0.0.0/22
Network Bit (N) 	= 22 
Host  Bit  (H) 	= 10

2^H= 2^10 = 1024  

In above VPC we got total host 1024 (Block Size)

Now we can create subnet inside  10.0.0.0/22 VPC.

we create 4 subnet,
1024/4 = 256 ( 8 host bit )

Sub IP		10.0.0.0		10.0.1.0		10.0.2.0		10.0.3.0
F.V.  IP		10.0.0.4		10.0.1.4		10.0.2.4		10.0.3.4
LV.  IP		10.0.0.254	10.0.1.254	10.0.2.254	10.0.3.254
Bro IP		10.0.0.255	10.0.1.255	10.0.2.255	10.0.3.255
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wipro company required 2 subnet ( account_subnet = 25 valid host & market_subnet= 25 valid host )

1. Idenfiy Host Bit for Subnet
2^H= 2^5= 32 ( block size)

Valid Host
2^H-5 = 32-5 = 27 

so we require 32+32 = 64 block size for both subnet means total 64   IP. (2^6= 64)
Now create VPC,

VPC =  10.0.0.0/26 

After Create VPC,
create subnet now,

Subnet1 (account_subnet ) = 10.0.0.0/27
Subnet2 (marketing_subnet ) = 10.0.0.32/27
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
