S3 Object Lifecycle Management:

S3 Object lifecycle can be managed by using a lifecycle configuration, which defines how S3 manages objects during their lifetime.
Lifecycle configuration enables simplification of object lifecycle management, for e.g. moving of less frequently access objects, backup or archival of data for several years, or permanent deletion of objects,
S3 controls all transitions automatically
Lifecycle Management rules applied to a bucket are applicable to all the existing objects in the bucket as well as the ones that will be added a new

S3 Object lifecycle management allows 2 types of behavior
There are 2 types of actions:

 Transition actions: Moving objects from one storage class to another storage class. Each storage class has a different cost associated with it.

 Expiration actions: When objects expire after a span of time (say 30 days,60 days, etc). Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf.
