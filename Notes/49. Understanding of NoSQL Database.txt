Introduction to NoSQL
NoSQL/Not Only SQL or Not SQL:

It was developed by Carl Strozri in 1998
It is a non-Relational DBMS.
It easy to scale
It provide greater flexibility than SQL because it store or handle structure, semistructure, unstructured and polymorphic data in the form of graph,charts, objects etc.
It lack of standardization of query language.
It required a documentation to rich community to learn and problem solving.

A NoSQL originally referring to non SQL or non relational is a database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data. This data is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

Came into existence in the late 1960s, but did not obtain the NoSQL alias until a flow of popularity in the early twenty-first century.

Popularly use to handle large database such as twitter,facebook,google,youtube etc. where store collect thousands of terabyte data.


Example of NoSql

- MongoDB
- Bigtable
- Redis
- Cassandra
- DynamoDB
- Reven

Out of Relatoinal DB(SQL) and NoSQL which is better is depend on which application we use it.
- NoSQL required low cost hardware
- NoSQL is faster than Relation Database
- Horizontal scaling easily possible in NoSQL.
- NoSQL is suitable for online database (analytical) processing.

Type of No-SQL Databases

1. Columan Database - 
This database store database in the formate of column instead of rows.

eg.
cassandra,HBase

2. Document Database -
It store the database in the formate in document formate.
eg.
MongoDB, CouchDB, RevenDB

3. Key Value Database -
It use key value like a primary key in relational database.
eg.
Redis, Riak, DynamoDB, TokyoCabinet.

4. Graph Based Database -
It store data in formate of graph.
eg.
Neo4J,FlockDB.
